Extract only the objective facts, direct actions, dates, and explicit statements from the following {content_type}.

Avoid speculation, bias, or inferred motives. Do not summarize. Your goal is to build a dataset of observable, verifiable facts.

Your response MUST be a valid, parseable JSON object in exactly this format:
{{
  "publication_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "facts": ["Fact 1", "Fact 2", "Fact 3"],
  "events": [

Analyze the following {content_type} for presentation bias, narrative framing, omitted context, and tone.

Break your analysis into:
1. FRAMING: What perspectives or ideologies are amplified?
2. OMISSIONS: What voices or facts are missing?
3. TONE & LANGUAGE: Is the language neutral or emotionally charged?
4. MANIPULATION: Are there rhetorical techniques that might subtly influence the reader?
5. DEMOCRATIC CONCERNS: What, if any, patterns or implications suggest risk to democratic norms?

Analyze the following {content_type} for potential authoritarian indicators.

Your task is to identify any patterns that may signal democratic erosion or authoritarian tendencies, such as:
- Attempts to undermine separation of powers
- Delegitimization of opposition, media, or institutions
- Expansion of executive authority
- Limitations on civil liberties or rights
- Erosion of electoral integrity
- Centralization of power
- Use of state resources for partisan advantage
- Degradation of factual discourse
- Promotion of us-vs-them narratives

NODE_EXTRACTION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
Extract every discrete fact, action, entity, or event from the following content. For each, produce a JSON object with:
- node_type: one of [{entity_types}]
- name: the precise name or title
- attributes: a key/value object with any additional details (e.g. role, party, branch, description)
- timestamp: the YYYY-MM-DD date associated (if none, use "N/A")
- source_sentence: the exact sentence containing this information

Pay special attention to identifying:
- narratives: recurring propaganda themes, framing techniques (e.g., "deep state", "enemy of the people")
- legal_frameworks: changes to laws and regulations (e.g., "Emergency Powers Act", "Anti-Protest Bill")
- procedural_norms: changes to governmental procedures (e.g., "Senate Confirmation Process", "Executive Oversight")

Given:
- the array of unique nodes (with id, node_type, name)
- the original facts JSON

Identify all relations among node IDs using ONLY these types:
[{relation_types}]

Important notes on relation types:
- Use 'justifies' when one node (often a narrative) is used to rationalize an action
- Use 'expands_power' when an action increases an actor's authority beyond normal bounds
- Use 'normalizes' when an action serves to make previously unacceptable behavior appear routine
- Use 'diverts_attention' when one event is used to distract from another
- Use 'targets' when specific groups or institutions are directly targeted

Note: Do NOT add 'precedes' or 'follows' relations - these will be inferred automatically from timestamps.

EDGE_ENRICHMENT_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
You are given a JSON array of edges and a publication_date.

- reasoning: a brief explanation for your severity and decayable assessments

For authoritarian relations (undermines, co-opts, purges, criminalizes, censors, intimidates, delegitimizes, 
restricts, targets), carefully assess the severity based on democratic norms.

If edge timestamp was "N/A", use the publication_date for assessment.
