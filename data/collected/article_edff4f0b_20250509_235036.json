But any jubilation on the American Make America Great Again right about the new Pope this week quickly dissipated as key voices from Donald Trump's Maga movement came to a disappointed conclusion: The first American Pope does not appear to be \"America first\". Little is known about the political leanings of Pope Leo XIV, born Robert Francis Prevost in Chicago. He has voiced concerns for the poor and immigrants, chosen a name that may reference more liberal church leadership, and he appears to have both supported the liberal-leaning Pope Francis and criticised the US president on social media. But the president so far has said only that Leo's election was a \"great honour\" for the US. Still, some of Trump's most prominent supporters were quick to attack Pope Leo, lambasting him as a possible challenge to Trump and on the perception that he will follow Pope Francis in areas like immigration. \"I mean it's kind of jaw-dropping,\" Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon told the BBC by phone on Friday, speaking of Leo's election. \"It is shocking to me that a guy could be selected to be the Pope that had had the Twitter feed and the statements he's had against American senior politicians,\" said Bannon, a hard-right Trump loyalist, practising Catholic and former altar boy. And he predicted that there's \"definitely going to be friction,\" between Leo and Trump. Pope Leo XIV calls Church 'a beacon to illuminate dark nights' in first Mass\n\nPope Leo XIV's first speech in full\n\nWho is Robert Prevost, the new Pope Leo XIV?\n\nWatch: 'Exciting day to be a Chicago Catholic' - Chicagoans react to Pope Leo XIV\n\nThe Pope's brother, John Prevost, told The New York Times that he thinks his brother would voice his disagreements with the president. \"I know he's not happy with what's going on with immigration,\" he said. \"I know that for a fact. How far he'll go with it is only one's guess, but he won't just sit back. I don't think he'll be the silent one.\" Recent survey data shows that about 20% of Americans identify as Catholic, according to the nonpartisan Pew Research Center. About 53% identify with or lean towards the Republican party, though there's plenty of nuance, too: America's two Catholic presidents, John F Kennedy and Joe Biden, were both Democrats. And nearly two-thirds of US Catholics believe abortion should be legal in all or most circumstances - a departure from the Church's current stance. US Catholics also broadly supported Pope Francis: 78% of those surveyed in February viewed him favorably, including a majority of Catholic Republicans. A number of Catholics in the Pope's home city of Chicago on Thursday aired disappointment with President Trump and said they hoped Pope Leo XIV would follow the path of his predecessor. \"We hope he'll continue with Francis's agenda going forward,\" said Rick Stevens, a Catholic deacon from New Jersey who happened to be visiting Chicago when he heard the news. The US Conference of Catholic Bishops, which leads and coordinates US Catholic activities, celebrated Pope Leo's election and the message it sends. \"Certainly, we rejoice that a son of this Nation has been chosen by the cardinals, but we recognize that he now belongs to all Catholics and to all people of good will,\" the conference said in a statement. \"His words advocating peace, unity, and missionary activity already indicate a path forward.\" Though Maga supporters represent a small subset of US Catholics, it's one with outsized access to conservative media and Trump's ear. On Bannon's War Room podcast - known for its hard-right, pro-Trump bent - one guest after another heaped criticism on the new Pope. \"This guy has been massively embraced by the liberals and the progressives,\" said Ben Harnwell, a journalist who led Bannon's efforts to establish what he calls a \"gladiator school\" for the \"Judeo-Christian West\" outside of Rome. \"He is one of their own… he has (Pope) Francis's DNA in him,\" Harnwell said.\n\nThe new Pope's brother, Louis Prevost, says his sibling was always dedicated to the church\n\nJack Posobiec, another Maga commentator dialing in from Rome, was blunt: \"This choice of the American cardinal was done as a response, as a message to President Trump.\" The full picture of what led to Pope Leo's selection on Thursday is still emerging and church decisions don't map neatly onto US politics. Still, watchers around the world have pored over Pope Leo's social media profiles in search of clues about his leanings and beliefs. An X account under his name, with tweets going as far back as 2015, shares links to criticism of Trump's approach to immigration and hints at other political views, such as sensible gun control. In February, the account sharply rebuked the US vice-president by posting a link to an opinion piece titled \"JD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn't ask us to rank our love for others\". The account also posted a link to a letter from Pope Francis, after he clashed with Vance over church doctrine and immigration. Vance – a Catholic convert – had given an interview in defence of the Trump administration's immigration policies. Vance has routinely invoked his faith in defense of the administration, particularly immigration policies, which the White House has said put \"America first\". \"There is a Christian concept that you love your family and then you love your neighbour, and then you love your community, and then you love your fellow citizens, and then after that, prioritise the rest of the world. A lot of the far left has completely inverted that,\" Vance told Fox News.\n\nBut US Democrats were not spared either on the account, which has more than a decade of posts. They appear to support Catholic employers who refuse to pay for contraceptives via employee health plans, and following the 2016 US presidential election, one post links to an article accusing Democrat Hillary Clinton of ignoring pro-life Catholic voters. The BBC asked the Vatican to confirm the account was Leo's, but has not received a response. The new Pope's LGBTQ views are also unclear, but some groups, including the conservative College of Cardinals, believe he may be less supportive than Pope Francis. Matt Walsh, a commentator with the conservative Daily Wire, wrote: \"There are some good signs and bad signs with this new Pope. I want to see what he actually does with his papacy before I pass any kind of judgment.\" But some of the most dedicated Maga supporters already have made up their minds. Laura Loomer, a far-right influencer who has Trump's ear, swaying the president on top personnel decisions, called the new Pope \"anti-Trump, anti-MAGA, pro-open Borders, and a total Marxist like Pope Francis\". Bannon, who had suggested Leo as a dark horse for the papacy, predicted tensions between the White House and Vatican - and said they could even tear apart American Catholics. \"Remember, President Trump was not shy about taking a shot at Pope Francis,\" he said. \"So if this Pope - which he will do - tries to come between President Trump and his implementation of the mass deportation programme, I would stand by.\" With reporting by Cai Pigliucci",
