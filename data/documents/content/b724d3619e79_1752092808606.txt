NewsNation host Chris Cuomo blasted Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) for blaming cuts to the federal government for the federal response to deadly flooding in Texas over the July Fourth holiday weekend.
“Democratic Senator Chris Murphy, I have been trying to get him on the show, now I don’t want him,” he said late Tuesday during his show “Cuomo.”
The host displayed a social media post from Murphy that read “Accurate weather forecasting helps avoid fatal disasters. There are consequences to Trump’s brainless attacks on public workers, like meteorologists.”
In response, Cuomo said: “You really believe that that’s what this was about? You really think that’s what your constituents want? For you to take a cheap shot at dead kids to score points against Trump? Wow.”
He added “I’m not saying there’s not reason for criticism, but it’s about perspective.”
The criticism comes after more than 100 people were killed as a result of the disastrous floods in Texas’s Kerr County — about an hour outside of San Antonio. That number includes more than two dozen children at an all-girls Christian summer camp just off the banks of the Guadalupe River.
More than 160 people have also been reported missing, according to officials.
“The union says there was adequate staff at the time in Texas. And meteorologists are not faulting the National Weather Service, they’re noting that they began to escalate the flood warnings as much as 12 hours in advance of the floods,” Cuomo continued in his rant against Murphy’s critique.
“So shut up, Murphy. We have to see that the interests of the many are being held hostage by the obsessions of the few on both sides,” he said. “They are killing us.”
The Senate Democrat was referring to the Trump administration’s moves to slash funds to climate research and weather forecasting agencies through its Department of Government Efficiency, most notably the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
