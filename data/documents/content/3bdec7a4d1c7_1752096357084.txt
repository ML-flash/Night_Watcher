WA Premier Roger Cook pulls back on WA climate change targets, says emissions may rise
In short:
WA Premier Roger Cook has downplayed the need for state climate target legislation, arguing federal targets already commit the state to net zero by 2050.
WA remains the only state without a 2030 emissions reduction target, and WA Labor's 2050 climate legislation has stalled in parliament, failing to progress before the March state election.
What's next?
The Greens have criticised the state government's climate stance, accusing Labor of favouring mining industry voices over environmental experts.
