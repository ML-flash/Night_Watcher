President William Ruto has officially dissolved the State Department for Performance and Delivery Management in a sweeping government reorganisation announced Thursday.
President Ruto’s latest directive, Executive Order No. 1 of 2025, effectively repeals the previous order and transfers the residual functions of the disbanded department to the Executive Office of the President.
The move now consolidates oversight of government performance under Deputy Head of Public Service Eliud Owalo, who now assumes greater responsibility for delivery and tracking across ministries.
"The new Order, serialised as Executive Order No.1 of 2025, repeals Executive Order No. 2 of 2023. This Order codifies various changes to the structure of Government, as previously notified," the statement signed by Head of Public Service Felix Koskei read in part.
The now-defunct department, previously housed under the Ministry of Public Service, was initially established through Executive Order No. 2 of 2023.
It had remained without a Principal Secretary since July 2024, when its former head, Veronica Nduva, was appointed Secretary General of the East African Community.
The reorganisation also reflects a reshaping of the Ministry of Public Service.
Notably, the performance and delivery docket was excluded from the restructured ministry.
Alongside the department’s dissolution, President Ruto announced the creation of several new state departments as part of his broader restructuring strategy.
These include: The State Department for National Government Coordination, the State Department for Science, Research and Innovation, and the State Department for Public Investments and Asset Management.
Others are; the State Department for Special Programmes, and the State Department for Aviation and Aerospace Development.
The changes mark a significant shift in the government’s administrative framework, expanding its scope and paving the way for additional Principal Secretary appointments under an increasingly diversified executive structure.
