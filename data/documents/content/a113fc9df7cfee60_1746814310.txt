On Wednesday, dozens of pro-Palestinian protesters stormed into Columbia University's main library.

According to a statement from the university president, two security officers were injured when protestors forced their way into Butler Library.

Protesters were blocked from leaving until they showed their Columbia IDs, or face arrest. More than 70 protesters were reportedly arrested; however, no one has yet been charged.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the visa statuses of those involved would be reviewed and called those involved "trespassers and vandals."
