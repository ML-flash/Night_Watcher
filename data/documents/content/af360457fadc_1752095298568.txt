WASHINGTON — Today, Ambassador Jamieson Greer issued the following statement in support of President Donald J. Trump invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose responsive tariffs to address the national emergency driven by the absence of reciprocity in our bilateral trade relationships.
“Today, President Trump is taking urgent action to protect the national security and economy of the United States. The current lack of trade reciprocity, demonstrated by our chronic trade deficit, has weakened our economic and national security. After only 72 days in office, President Trump has prioritized swift action to bring reciprocity to our trade relations and reduce the trade deficit by leveling the playing field for American workers and manufacturers, reshoring American jobs, expanding our domestic manufacturing base, and ensuring our defense-industrial base is not dependent on foreign adversaries—all leading to stronger economic and national security.”
