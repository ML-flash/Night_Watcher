The Senate by a vote of 51 to 48 passed its revised budget resolution for fiscal year 2025 with Sens. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Susan Collins, R-Maine, voting with Democrats in opposition. This marks the next step toward reaching a budget resolution that will allow Congress to move forward with the reconciliation process.
During the six-hour “vote-a-rama session,” Sen. Ron Wyden, R-Ore., offered an amendment to strike the instructions for the House Energy & Commerce Committee to cut spending by $880 billion, citing his concerns around potential cuts to the Medicaid program. The amendment was not agreed to by a vote of 49-50. Three Republicans, Sens. Collins, Josh Hawley, R-Mo., and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, voted in favor of the amendment along with Senate Democrats.
The House is expected to consider the revised resolution as early as next week. AHA members April 3 received a Special Bulletin for highlights of what’s included in the revised budget resolution and AHA resources.
