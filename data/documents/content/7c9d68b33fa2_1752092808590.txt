President Trump on Wednesday welcomed the presidents of Senegal, Liberia, Guinea-Bissau, Mauritania and Gabon to the White House for a luncheon.
The business lunch was set to focus on “commercial opportunities” — though few details were provided. The conversation comes after Trump announced earlier this week that a pause on reciprocal tariffs will end early next month and new rates would be announced — though the five nations participating in the summit were not among the trading partners slapped with high import taxes in April, just the baseline 10 percent.
It also followed a federal judge’s ruling blocking the Trump administration from appointing a new head of the U.S. African Development Foundation (USADF), indefinitely halting a February executive order that would massively slash the agency’s workforce and grant funding.
