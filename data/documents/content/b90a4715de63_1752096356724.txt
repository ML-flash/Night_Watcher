Congress MP Kiran Kumar Chamala on Saturday criticised Union Minister Giriraj Singh's remarks about the Congress party's candle march.
Speaking to ANI, Congress MP Kiran Kumar Chamala said, "Giriraj Singh was talking about the Congress party's candle march and is trying to say that Congress supports the terrorists. Congress is showing solidarity and uniting. We are clearly saying that there is no politics in this... BJP doesn't want to digest whenever Congress tries to do such programs to bring people to attention... We are today blaming the BJP for the intelligence failure, and such things should not be repeated, which is the responsibility of the central government..." Chamala said that Giriraj is still trying to say that Congress supports the terrorists and emphasised that the party's march was meant to show solidarity, not engage in politics. He also accused the BJP of failing to acknowledge the intelligence lapses in the Pahalgam terror attack and called on the central government to ensure such incidents do not happen again. Recently, Giriraj Singh lashed out at the opposition parties, including Congress and RJD, over their response to the recent Pahalgam terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir. Singh expressed his disappointment that these parties are holding candle marches and demanding an inquiry committee to investigate the attack. Singh pointed out that the opposition's demand for proof of surgical strikes and investigation into the Pahalgam attack is hypocritical. He said, "I feel sorry for parties like Congress and RJD, which hold candle marches in Bihar and demand investigations and committees for this. They should feel ashamed. They want proof for surgical strikes and even talk about investigating the incident that took place in Pulwama. This is a matter of shame. RJD, which says it will turn Bihar and Bengal into Bihar, is both inflicting wounds on one side and sprinkling salt on them on the other." On April 22, terrorists attacked tourists at Baisaran meadow in Pahalgam, killing 25 Indian nationals and one Nepali citizen while leaving several others injured. (ANI)
