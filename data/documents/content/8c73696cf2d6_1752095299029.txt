Federal judge blocks mass layoffs at HHS
Key takeaways:
- A federal judge granted a preliminary injunction to halt the HHS layoffs announced in March.
- HHS said it is reviewing the judge’s decision and considering next steps.
A federal judge this week granted a preliminary injunction to halt mass layoffs at HHS, saying the Trump administration was not authorized to make sweeping changes to an agency created by Congress.
The decision, handed down by U.S. District Court Judge Melissa R. DuBose in Rhode Island on Tuesday, halts the vast layoffs and significant reorganization of the country’s federal public health infrastructure while the case is being presented in court.
A coalition of 20 attorneys general filed suit in May to stop the cuts, arguing that they were illegal and harmful to the public. In her ruling, DuBose agreed, saying HHS “does not have the authority to order, organize, or implement wholesale changes to the structure and function of the agencies created by Congress.”
In a statement, HHS spokesperson Andrew G. Nixon told Healio that the administration stands by its reorganization plan as it reviews the district court’s decision and considers next steps.
“The reorganization was designed to restore the department around bold, measurable public health goals — like reversing the chronic disease epidemic and advancing U.S. leadership biomedical research,” Nixon said. “While we strongly disagree with the decision by a Biden-appointed district court judge, HHS remains committed to modernizing a health workforce that for too long prioritized institutional preservation over meaningful public health impact.”
HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced a plan in March to lay off roughly one-quarter of HHS’s staff, halving the number of its regional offices, consolidating the departments’ 28 divisions down to 15 and reorienting the department’s priorities to reflect those of the Trump administration.
Working with the Department of Government Efficiency, HHS terminated roughly 10,000 people nearly immediately, leaving offices across the department unstaffed as many workers learned they had been let go when they were locked out of their offices or deactivated from government systems, according to the office of New York State Attorney General Letitia James.
Notably, the cuts impacted:
- CDC divisions focused on global health, HIV, injury prevention, STIs, tuberculosis and workplace safety;
- the FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products;
- the Office of Head Start;
- the World Trade Center Health Program;
- federal poverty guideline calculations; and
- 10,000 more layoffs, which were enacted in the weeks after Kennedy’s announcement and the initial firing of 10,000 people.
James’ office said the preliminary injunction granted by DuBose blocks “further implementation of the restructuring and [stops] the termination of employees” caught up in the cuts.
The injunction, “guarantees these programs and services will remain accessible and halts the administration’s attempt to sabotage our nation’s health care system,” James said in the release.
“HHS is the backbone of our nation’s public health and social safety net — from cancer screenings and maternal health to early childhood education and domestic violence prevention,” she said.
The administration has already rehired employees from the World Trade Center Health Program, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, and several CDC and NIH divisions, including at the CDC’s National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD and Tuberculosis Prevention.
In her decision, DuBose noted that she granted the injunction because the attorneys general also showed that the reorganization is causing harm to their states, including to the “symbiotic relationship” they have with the CDC for an array of services, and interfering with dependence they and constituents have on guidance and services provided by agencies across HHS.
