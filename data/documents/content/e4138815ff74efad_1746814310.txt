The BBC's US State Department correspondent Tom Bateman has questioned President Donald Trump over the UK's refusal to accept some types of American beef.

The Oval Office exchange came as Trump and Prime Minister Keir Starmer unveiled a trade deal.

Food standards in the UK ban imports of treated beef or chlorinated chicken - measures that will remain in place despite the deal, according to officials.

The White House said the deal would unlock "billions of dollars" in increased market access for US beef, ethanol and other agricultural products.
