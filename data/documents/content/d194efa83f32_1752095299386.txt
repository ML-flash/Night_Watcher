WASHINGTON (TNND) — The Department of Health and Human Services opened a Title IX investigation into the state of Minnesota after a transgender pitcher led a softball team to the 4A state title. Marissa Rothenberger, a junior at Champlin Park High School, pitched every inning of the Minnesota Girls State Softball Tournament, culminating in a complete shutout in the final game to secure the title.
This move comes a day after the U.S. Department of Education concluded a similar investigation in California, finding the state in violation of Title IX for permitting transgender athletes to participate in girls' and women's sports. The debate had intensified after a transgender athlete won two state titles in track and field in a year.
"We’ve really been working on this issue for a while, really wanting to see girls in California once have safe sports and safe spaces again," said Sophia Lorey, the outreach director for the California Family Council.
Former U.S. Rep. Katie Porter of California told CNN, "There are issues of fairness here. I think the question is, who’s job is this to fix. Do we think the leader of the free world, Donald Trump should be weighing in. Because he doesn’t trust a sporting body to solve the problem."
President Donald Trump issued an executive order in February aimed at enforcing Title IX to effectively ban transgender girls and women from female sports. The order faces legal challenges, including one from Maine, where the Democratic-controlled state legislature narrowly passed a bill to ban transgender athletes from women's and girls' sports, though it failed in the Senate.
Currently, 27 states have laws prohibiting transgender athletes from competing in women's sports.
