The Oversight Project has released a disturbing new findings showing an apparent correlation between the increased use of autopen signatures and Joe Biden‚Äôs worsening mental decline.
The group previously found that two different autopens were used, pointing out that Neera Tanden was the White House Staff Secretary when Biden autopenned pardons from a golf course in the US Virgin Islands.

We analyzed Biden's Jan. 19, 2025 "pardons" for:
-Biden Family Members
-Anthony Fauci
-General Milley
-J6 Committee
-Gerald Lundergan
They all have the same exact Biden autopen signature https://t.co/jc6mkx37il pic.twitter.com/8VeBDwLNv7
Now a further analysis of Executive Order signatures shows an ‚Äúincreased use of the autopen as President Biden‚Äôs mental and physical decline accelerated,‚Äù according to the group.
The findings show that Biden used a wet signature on every single Executive Order during his first 18 months in office.
However, this radically changed in late Spring of 2022 when around half of the orders were autopenned. By the Summer, 100 percent of the orders were being signed by autopen.
In 2023, two thirds of the orders were autopenned, and in 2024 that figure rose to three quarters, before again hitting 100 percent in the last days of his presidency in 2025.
The Oversight Project notes:
Our investigation highlights several Executive Orders that are particularly concerning due to their political weight. These orders, all signed with the autopen, address sensitive issues such as national security, public health, and military justice. Below are key examples:
- Executive Order 14097: Combating International Drug Trafficking (April 27, 2023)
This order authorized the activation of the Ready Reserve of the Armed Forces to address international drug trafficking, expanding emergency powers to combat a national security threat.
- Executive Order 14098: Sanctions on Sudan (May 4, 2023)
This order imposed sanctions on individuals destabilizing Sudan, addressing threats to U.S. national security and foreign policy.
- Executive Order 14114: Countering Russian Aggression (December 22, 2023)
This order expanded sanctions targeting Russia‚Äôs military-industrial base and financial institutions, amending prior orders to counter Russian aggression.
- Executive Order 14118: Terminating the Zimbabwe Emergency (March 4, 2024)
This order revoked a national emergency regarding Zimbabwe, acknowledging ongoing concerns about violence and corruption while lifting sanctions.
- Executive Order 14122: Public Health Preparedness (April 12, 2024)
Focused on COVID-19 and public health, this order transferred responsibilities to the Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR) and revoked COVID-19-related orders.
- Executive Order 14130: Amending the Manual for Courts-Martial (December 20, 2024)
This order updated the Manual for Courts-Martial to align with legislative changes, including randomized selection of court-martial members.
The new findings come after President Trump called for those who operated Biden‚Äôs autopen to be jailed.
Trump has declared that all of the pardons issued by ‚ÄòJoe Biden‚Äô in the final days of his fake Presidency should be void because he didn‚Äôt sign any of them.
