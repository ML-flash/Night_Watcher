Cricket-fan Mr Sunak dished out gongs to some of his closest political allies including Michael Gove. The Brexiteer served in the cabinets of four prime ministers before standing down as an MP ahead of last July's general election.

Former England cricketer James Anderson has been awarded a knighthood in Rishi Sunak â€™s resignation honours list. Sir James, who retired from test cricket in July having taken more wickets than any fast bowler in test history, is joined on the list by a number of Tory politicians who received peerages and knighthoods.
