It has been at least 30 years since an Idaho legislative session has featured as many prepared pieces of legislation as the recent 2025 session at the State Capitol in Boise.
During the entire 2025 session, legislators and bill drafters prepared 1,378 pieces of legislation, according to the official Sine Die report compiled and published by the Idaho Legislative Services Office.
