Several members of the Philadelphia Eagles celebrated their Super Bowl win by visiting President Donald Trump at the White House.
The annual White House visit of the Super Bowl-winning team took place on Monday afternoon (April 28) in Washington, D.C.
While several teammates, including quarterback Jalen Hurts did not attend, running back Saquon Barkley spent time with Trump over the weekend in New Jersey and then traveled with him to D.C. on Marine One.
Saquon tweeted, "lol some people are really upset cause I played golfed and flew to the White House with the PRESIDENT. Maybe I just respect the office, not a hard concept to understand. Just golfed with Obama not too long agoâ€¦and look forward to finishing my round with Trump ! Now ya get out my mentions with all this politics and have amazing day ðŸ˜‚."
A White House official says that Hurts and other players didn't attend due to "scheduling conflicts."
