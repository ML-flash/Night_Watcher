LANSING, Mich. (May 22, 2025) — This week, a bipartisan group of Michigan senators introduced a bill package to improve police practices and strengthen community trust and safety. Michiganders across the political spectrum want and deserve safety in their communities and that includes safety in interactions with law enforcement. This Police Practices Standardization, Transparency, and Trust (S.T.A.T.) legislation, comprised of Senate Bills 333-343, would make reasonable and practical changes to how police officers handle interactions with community members to prevent the use of excessive force. Crafted through extensive work with community stakeholders and law enforcement, these common-sense reforms would ensure Michigan remains a leader in advancing policies that enhance public safety and uphold justice for all.
“Improving police and community trust is crucial for public safety,” said Sen. Stephanie Chang (D-Detroit), lead sponsor of the bill package. “I am proud to work alongside my colleagues on both sides of the aisle on this commonsense, bipartisan bill package to increase transparency and make sure that, no matter where you live in the state, you can expect to be treated with dignity and respect by law enforcement officers. By ensuring strong use of force policies, we can save lives of both officers and community members.”
In addition to Sen. Chang, this commonsense, bipartisan legislative package is sponsored by Sens. Erika Geiss (D-Taylor), Ruth Johnson (R-Holly), Sylvia Santana (D-Detroit), Jeff Irwin (D-Ann Arbor), Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing), Jeremy Moss (D-Southfield), Roger Victory (R-Hudsonville), Ed McBroom (R-Waucedah Twp.), and Mary Cavanagh (D-Redford Twp.), and is comprised of the following bills:
-
SB 336 (GEISS): Limits use of no-knock warrants, providing several specific instructions regarding when and how they can be used by an officer who must be in uniform or identifiable as a police officer.
-
SB 335 (JOHNSON): Requires all law enforcement agencies adopt a duty to intervene policy, which would direct officers to intervene when observing another officer using excessive force and report the incident to the immediate supervisor.
-
SB 333 (CHANG): Mandates all police agencies create use-of-force policies that include a requirement for officers to only use physical force that is “objectively reasonable;” standards for and alternatives to using physical force, including de-escalation techniques; and classifying chokeholds as “deadly force.”
-
SBs 337-338 (SANTANA): Cracks down on body camera tampering, allowing digital images or video audio recordings from body-worn cameras be permitted as “tampering with evidence.” The bill also prohibits an officer from purposely deactivating a camera while using excessive force.
-
SB 334 (IRWIN): Requires law enforcement officers receive training vetted by behavioral health experts in de-escalation techniques, implicit bias, procedural justice, and crisis response.
-
SB 341 (ANTHONY): Requires the Michigan Commission on Law Enforcement Standards (MCOLES) to ensure consistency in background checks prior to licensure of an individual and revoke a license if the individual is convicted of a misdemeanor involving domestic violence.
-
SBs 339-340 (MOSS, VICTORY): Requires a separation record to include any disciplinary process or investigation against an officer; gives MCOLES the authority to create a provisional separation of service record; and guarantees due process for an officer if they disagree with the contents of their separation of service or provisional separation of service records.
-
SB 342 (MCBROOM): Ensures that protection for compulsory statements by police officers during internal investigations of wrongdoing will only protect truthful statements.
-
SB 344 (CAVANAGH): Prohibits a person from knowingly disclosing information in a misconduct complaint against an officer that personally identifies the individual who filed the complaint unless there is a court order or the person who filed the complaint gives permission to be identified.
“Many agencies, including the Oakland County Sheriff’s department, have had common-sense duty to intervene policies in place for decades,” said Sen. Johnson. “My bill would ensure that all law enforcement officers in Michigan are empowered by their departments to speak up when they see wrongdoing.”
“People in every corner of the state want the same thing: to feel safe in their communities and to know that law enforcement is working in a way that reflects their values,” said Sen. Anthony. “This bipartisan package is about making sure our institutions live up to that trust. My bill streamlines the Michigan Commission on Law Enforcement Standards Act to ensure consistent practices and empowers them to take clear, corrective action when bad actors undermine their responsibilities. It’s a step toward rebuilding confidence where it’s been shaken and making sure our public safety systems work for everyone.”
This bipartisan package was developed over the course of about five years and has incorporated extensive feedback from law enforcement stakeholders such as the Michigan State Police, the Michigan Commission on Law Enforcement Standards (MCOLES), statewide law enforcement organizations, law enforcement leaders around the state, as well as community stakeholders. From Louisiana to Minnesota, many of the elements of this bill package are similar to what other states have been implementing around the country, even building upon already existing policies in many of Michigan’s law enforcement agencies. Research has shown that strong use of force policies are associated with police officers less likely to be killed in the line of duty and less likely to be assaulted, along with fewer police killings per capita.
“Police officers help to keep people safe by deterring, investigating, and interrupting criminal activity,” said Ally Alfonsetti, legislative strategist for Prison Fellowship. “Lawmakers in Lansing have an opportunity to foster community trust and equip law enforcement with transparent and standardized practices by passing the Police Practices S.T.A.T. legislation (Senate Bills 333-343).”
“I wrote and passed the original law on police separation records. I believe these bills will improve that law,” said former Senator and Eaton County Sheriff Rick Jones. “A police officer’s record of behavior must be permanent and available to future police employers.”
Improving accountability in our police departments is not just an issue shared by legislators on both sides of the aisle; Michiganders across the political spectrum want safety in their communities as well, and that includes safety in interactions with law enforcement officials. Results from a 2023 YouGov poll show that among Michiganders, 90% support duty to intervene policies, 78% support body cam tampering policies, and 74% support use of force policies, alongside other data showcasing their support for policies to improve police standards and community trust.
“Citizens need honest and factual answers when investigating incidents between criminals and police officers,” said Sen. McBroom. “This bill makes a very important change to disallow false answers from law enforcement officers when verifying their lawful actions.”
Along with the support of bipartisan state policymakers and Michigan residents, several faith leaders, community groups, and councils are also calling for its adoption, including Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s Black Leadership Advisory Council, the Michigan Legislative Black Caucus, Everytown for Gun Safety, Law Enforcement Action Partnership, ACLU of Michigan, NAACP Michigan State Conference, NAACP Detroit Branch, Michigan Catholic Conference, Prison Fellowship, Safe and Just Michigan, and the Michigan Collaborative to End Mass Incarceration.
The Police Practices S.T.A.T. legislation is similar to bills that were taken up in the Senate during the last legislative session but didn’t make it to the governor’s desk. The package now awaits consideration in the Senate Committee on Civil Rights, Judiciary, and Public Safety.
