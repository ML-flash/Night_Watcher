WASHINGTON (TNND) â€” President Donald Trump signed seven executive orders focused on education on Wednesday afternoon.
Full list of Executive Orders signed:
- Executive order that requires full and timely disclosure by higher education institutions when they receive large foreign gifts.
- Executive order that overhauls the accreditation system for colleges and universities.
- Executive order creating workforce development opportunities for young Americans in artificial intelligence.
- Executive order to establish an initiative to enhance the capacity of Historically Black Colleges and Universities to deliver high-quality education.
- Executive order to modernize workforce programs to prepare citizens for high-paying, skilled trade jobs.
- Executive order eliminating the use of "disparate-impact liability" to ensure equal treatment under the law.
- Executive order on school discipline policies, revoking the Obama-Biden guidance that had schools impose discipline based on racial equity.
Trump has said that the executive order to change the higher education accreditation system is his "secret weapon" to remake higher education. According to administration officials, the order is supposed to put more of a focus on intellectual diversity across the faculty. It would also make it easier for colleges and universities to switch to new accreditors to gain federal approval.
Accreditors are crucial for universities because they set the standard for higher education institutions to qualify to access federal financial aid. It is rare for a college or university to lose its accreditation.
The White House initiative to empower HBCUs is designed to further promote schools that both Trump and former President Joe Biden have prioritized. This executive order will remove traditional barriers for HBCUs to receive grant funding, as well as promote partnerships in industries like technology and finance to prepare the school's workforce.
The Department of Education and the Department of Labor have also been tasked with working with K-12 schools to promote AI education. Trump is also creating a White House task force on AI Education, which will include Education Secretary Linda McMahon, Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer. Michael Kratsios, the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology, will be chairing the task force.
Currently, the government requires colleges and universities to disclose foreign gifts that are worth $250,000 or more. Trump's executive order says that foreign gifts could be revoked if they do not abide by the newly imposed disclosure requirements. Education Secretary McMahon would require higher education institutions to disclose the purpose of the federal funds as well as the source from which they came.
Since taking office, the Trump administration has worked to dismantle the Department of Education.
