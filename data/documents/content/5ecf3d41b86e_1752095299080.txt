(HARTFORD, CT) – Governor Ned Lamont today announced that he is forwarding to the Connecticut General Assembly the nominations of several jurists to serve in positions on Connecticut’s courts, including the Honorable William H. Bright, Jr. as an associate justice of the Supreme Court, the Honorable Robin L. Wilson as a judge of the Appellate Court, and 13 other jurists as judges of the Superior Court.
Additionally, the governor is nominating two jurists to serve as family support magistrates and three as administrative law judges on the Workers’ Compensation Commission.
“Nominating judges to serve on our courts is one of the most important responsibilities of a governor, especially because judges are the final authority on the interpretation of the law and the constitution, and for ensuring that justice is administered fairly and without prejudice,” Governor Lamont said. “Judge Bright has been an excellent leader of our Appellate Court over these last four and a half years, and he has had an impressive career handling all types of cases both on the trial and appellate levels. Likewise, Judge Wilson is an incredibly well-respected member of Connecticut’s legal community, having served in the Superior Court for more than two decades. I am confident that these nominees each have the high standards and qualifications the people of Connecticut deserve to have serving for them on the bench.”
Judge Bright, 62, of Columbia, is currently the chief judge of the Appellate Court. He is being nominated to fill the associate justice seat on the Supreme Court that was most recently held by the Honorable Raheem L. Mullins, who was recently nominated by Governor Lamont to become chief justice.
Judge Bright has served on the Appellate Court since 2017 and as chief judge since 2020. In the role of chief judge, he has been responsible for managing the operations of the Appellate Court, in addition to sitting on a full docket of cases, assigning cases to authoring judges, reviewing all opinions of the court before publication, overseeing clerks for judge trial referees, and addressing personnel and building management issues.
Immediately prior to his nomination to the Appellate Court, Judge Bright served as a judge of the Superior Court from 2008 to 2017, presiding over criminal, civil, habeas corpus, and juvenile trials. While on the Superior Court, he served as the presiding judge of the Connecticut Judicial Branch’s statewide mediation program in 2017, chief administrative judge for civil matters from 2015 to 2017, administrative and presiding judge for the Tolland Judicial District from 2013 to 2017, and presiding judge of a civil complex litigation docket from 2011 to 2013.
Before being nominated to the bench, he was a partner with the law firm of McCarter and English from 2003 to 2008, and with Cummings and Lockwood from 1987 to 2003. With both firms, he worked as a trial attorney, handling cases in both state and federal courts and representing individuals, government entities, and small and large businesses in environmental, property, and commercial matters.
Judge Bright graduated from Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, summa cum laude, and earned a Juris Doctor degree, with honors, from the University of Chicago Law School. He is a James W. Cooper Fellow of the Connecticut Bar Foundation and a member emeritus of the Oliver Ellsworth Inn of Court.
“I want to thank Governor Lamont for his faith and confidence in me,” Judge Bright said. “It is truly an honor to be nominated and considered for a position on our state’s highest court. It has been my distinct pleasure to serve the people of Connecticut as a judge of the Superior Court and the Appellate Court over the past 17 years. If confirmed, I promise to bring to my job as an associate justice of our Supreme Court the same work ethic, fidelity to the law, and respect for the parties and attorneys who appear before us that I have strived to demonstrate every day since becoming a judge.”
Judge Wilson, 64, of New Haven, is currently a judge of the Superior Court, where she has served since 2003. She is being nominated to fill the seat on the Appellate Court that will become vacant following the confirmation of Judge Bright to serve on the Supreme Court.
Judge Wilson is presently assigned to the Waterbury Complex Litigation Docket, presiding over complex civil cases. Prior to this, she served in the Civil Division of the New Haven Judicial District for 15 years, also presiding over complex civil cases, including medical and legal malpractice cases, motor vehicle accident cases involving catastrophic injuries, and commercial contract disputes.
Immediately prior to her nomination to the Superior Court, she served as an administrative law judge on the Workers’ Compensation Commission from 1994 to 2003. She also worked from 1986 to 1994 as an assistant attorney general in the Connecticut Office of the Attorney General, serving in both the Child Support Department and the Workers’ Compensation Department.
In recognition of her influence and leadership, Judge Wilson has been honored as one of the NAACP’s 100 Most Influential Blacks in Connecticut and as one of the 100 Women of Color Leadership in the State of Connecticut.
Judge Wilson earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in government, with honors, from Connecticut College, a Juris Doctor degree from Northeastern University School of Law, and a Master of Laws degree in labor relations from New York University School of Law.
“I am deeply honored and humbled by Governor Lamont’s nomination to serve as an Appellate Judge for the State of Connecticut,” Judge Wilson said. “It is an absolute honor and privilege to have this opportunity. If confirmed by the legislature, I am committed to upholding the principles of fairness, justice, and integrity as I take on this important responsibility and will work hard every day to prove myself worthy of the governor’s trust. Thank you, Governor Lamont, for entrusting me with this opportunity to serve our great state.”
