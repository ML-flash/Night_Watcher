After weeks of hearing bills from both sides of the aisle, it was all smiles early Thursday for the House State Government Finance and Policy Committee.
State government omnibus policy bill approved in committee 4/3/25
There are a number of policy provisions in it that members from both sides of the aisle should support, said Rep. Jim Nash (R-Waconia). He and Klevorn are the committee co-chairs.
Nash offered a potential scheduling challenge to House leaders. “Hopefully we win the race of first policy bill voted off the floor.”
That is the bill’s next stop after the committee easily gave its approval.
Among its provisions:
the head of any state agency could withhold payments to a program participant in any program administered by that agency if the agency head determines there is a credible allegation of fraud under investigation and the program participant is a subject of the investigation;
a government entity could disclose any data to another government entity or law enforcement if the data relates to public program fraud;
state employees would receive better whistleblower protection when reporting state program information, including suspected fraud;
a retained savings program would be reestablished to encourage agency innovation and cost-savings;
inactive legislative commissions would be repealed; and
the giant beaver and Ursa Minor would become state symbols.
