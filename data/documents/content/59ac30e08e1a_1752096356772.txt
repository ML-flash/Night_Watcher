During a recent interaction in Boston, Gandhi alleged that the Election Commission (EC) is "compromised and there is something wrong with the system".
"The anger Congress has towards the ED is being directed at the Election Commission," BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra told reporters at the party headquarters in Delhi. "Nothing can be gained from this, as agencies like the ED work based on facts, and this is an open-and-shut case."
Patra said that in the 2024 Lok Sabha election, the BJP won 240 seats while Congress secured only 99, "and yet, they (Congress) celebrated and claimed it as a loss for the BJP".
"So, was the Election Commission compromised by Congress? Even in the Ayodhya elections, they celebrated your victory. How was this possible?" Patra said. "It was possible because India has free and fair elections. Rahul Gandhi, who insults India abroad, must remember that he is out on bail for â‚¹50,000."
