Trump takes his feud with GOP Rep. Thomas Massie to a new level
By Scott Bland
Rep. Thomas Massie has been an intraparty irritant to Donald Trump for years, but never to the point that the president decided to actually try to squash the Kentucky Republican in a primary. Until now.
Two of Trump’s top political advisers are launching a super PAC dedicated to opposing Massie in his 2026 primary, after Massie’s criticism of the Trump-ordered U.S. strikes in Iran this weekend. Trump and Massie have also been trading barbs on social media over the past 48 hours, with Trump posting on Truth Social, “GET THIS “BUM” OUT OF OFFICE, ASAP!!!,” and Massie saying on X that the president’s actions are not “American First.”
But the formation of the new political group is a step further than Trump has ever gone despite past annoyance with Massie, often a lonely, libertarian-inspired “no” vote even when most of the House GOP is supporting something — like last month’s vote to advance Trump’s tax and spending package.
It’s set to be one of next year’s early tests of Trump’s grip on the Republican Party, the power of the political war chest he continues to accumulate despite being term-limited, and the ability of remaining holdouts against his top-down version of the GOP to maintain any traction locally.
Before this election cycle, Massie had courted Trump’s ire on several other high-profile occasions, including an early Covid relief effort in 2020, when Trump called him a “third rate Grandstander” on social media.
Massie was one of a handful of House Republicans who endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for president over Trump in the 2024 primary, too. Once again, Trump’s anger over that stopped short of an actual endorsement for a primary opponent.
Now, though, it seems that the president’s annoyance is going to come down on Massie along with his money and maybe even that powerful endorsement, if Team Trump can find a credible challenger this time around. Massie is using Trump’s opposition as a fundraising opportunity of his own, but it’s not going to measure up to whatever Trump can air-drop into Kentucky against him.
As Jonathan Allen points out, Trump has targeted Republican incumbents in primaries before. Most notably, in the 2022 election cycle he sought to unseat GOP lawmakers who voted to impeach him after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Ultimately, eight of the 10 House Republicans lost their primaries or declined to seek re-election.
And last year, Trump backed John McGuire’s successful primary challenge to Virginia’s Bob Good, who was the chair of the House Freedom Caucus at the time.
Trump announces ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran
President Donald Trump announced on Truth Social this evening that Israel and Iran had agreed to a ceasefire.
“CONGRATULATIONS TO EVERYONE! It has been fully agreed by and between Israel and Iran that there will be a Complete and Total CEASEFIRE (in approximately 6 hours from now, when Israel and Iran have wound down and completed their in progress, final missions!), for 12 hours, at which point the War will be considered, ENDED!,” Trump wrote.
The announcement came hours after Iran launched a missile strike against Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, which stations thousands of U.S. troops, in retaliation for the U.S. bombing its nuclear sites over the weekend.
Trump had said that no Americans were harmed and that “hardly any damage was done.” He added that Iran gave “early notice” of the attack.
