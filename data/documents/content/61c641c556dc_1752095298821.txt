Below are key excerpts from today’s hearing:
Subcommittee Vice Chairman Rick Allen (GA-12): “Access to telecommunications isn't just a luxury. It's something Americans depend on every single day. Students need it to finish their homework. Folks of all ages, especially in rural communities, rely on it for telehealth visits with their doctors, and small businesses use it to reach customers and keep the doors open. And let's not forget, we all use it to stay in touch with friends and loved ones. Additionally, when natural disasters strike, access to reliable communication becomes even more critical.”
Congressman John Joyce (PA-13): “Spectrum is a finite resource, and we must ensure that we're being innovative and thoughtful when forming any spectrum legislation moving forward. Solving this spectrum auction authority lapse and generating new spectrum policy is my top priority on this subcommittee, and I look forward to working with Chairman Hudson on getting this across the finish line.”
Congresswoman Erin Houchin (IN-09): “While we may not realize it, spectrum directly impacts the ways in which millions of Americans go about their daily lives both at home and at work. From listening to the radio to watching television, to using cell phones and browsing the internet, spectrum determines how these devices carry data. That said, it is a limited resource, and I recognize that the United States must play a leading role in innovation relative to spectrum to maintain our position as the world's leader in new technology.”
