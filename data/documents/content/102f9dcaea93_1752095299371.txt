BUFFALO, N.Y. (WIVB) — An internal affairs investigation was launched with Buffalo police following an incident involving a patrol vehicle and an ATV that occurred on Sunday.
Footage of the incident, which was caught on camera and provided to WIVB News 4 by a resident, is raising questions as to what happened between the patrol unit and the person driving the ATV.
The video shows a Buffalo police patrol vehicle following an ATV through Waterfront/Emerson Young Park on the afternoon of Sunday, May 25. In the video, an impact can be seen taking place, resulting in the person operating the ATV falling off the four-wheeler.
An internal affairs investigation is now underway, according to Buffalo Police Commissioner Alphonso Wright.
“The Buffalo Police Department is aware of an incident that occurred on May 25th, involving a marked patrol vehicle and an ATV during a detail addressing ATV activity and stolen vehicles,” Wright said in a statement to News 4. “In accordance with standard procedure for incidents of this nature, an Internal Affairs investigation is underway to gather all relevant facts. We are committed to a thorough and impartial review and will provide updates as appropriate once the investigation is complete.”
Chases must be called off if they’re too dangerous, according to the Buffalo police policy pertaining to pursuits.
Jerry Rodriguez, a police practices expert and retired Baltimore deputy police commissioner with over 35 years of experience in law enforcement, reviewed the footage and feels it should’ve never happened.
“I see an incident that should’ve been prevented,” he said. “I see an incident that should not have happened. While I don’t want to diminish the fact that these illegal riders of quads are tormenting many of our motorists in busy areas, they come at great risk.”
