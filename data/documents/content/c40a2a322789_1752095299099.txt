Verizon launches government cloud-managed SD WAN to accelerate federal agency modernization
WASHINGTON, D.C. - Verizon today announced the launch of its first Government Cloud-Managed Software Defined Wide Area Network (SD WAN) product. Built on Verizon’s Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) High Ready Government Cloud Platform for U.S. federal agencies, the new offering is highlighted by the platform’s first SaaS Managed SD WAN solution. This innovative offering, already FedRAMP High Ready and built to NIST 800-53 controls, provides Federal agencies with a secure, scalable, and modernized network infrastructure tailored to meet their unique network and connectivity requirements.
Built to meet the stringent security demands of federal cloud environments, the Verizon Business product was developed in alignment with the federal government’s ongoing transition to cloud-based technologies, providing a competitive edge by uniquely integrating with Verizon’s secure and reliable network. This synergy enhances operational efficiency, supports mission-critical applications, and empowers agencies to achieve their modernization goals with a seamless, scalable, and secure platform for the future.
“Federal agencies continue to look for opportunities to leverage the latest technology to increase efficiency, while also modernizing their network infrastructure with the required compliance and security,” said Kim Mirabella, vice president for business development and strategic sales at Verizon. “Verizon’s Government Cloud-Managed SD WAN delivers tailored solutions that empower agencies to meet these demands more efficiently, while reallocating critical resources and accelerating the deployment of cutting-edge technology.”
