Effective today (May 6), the United States Government Policy for Oversight of Dual Use Research of Concern and Pathogens with Enhanced Pandemic Potential will require institutions receiving federal funding to provide additional oversight and notification to federal funding agencies related to certain types of pathogen research.
The policy covers all research with infectious pathogens and requires the principal investigator to acknowledge and report certain types of research to federal funding agencies at the time of proposal.
The WVU Biosafety Officer and Institutional Biosafety Committee will also review research proposals for pathogens and help ensure compliance. The specifics are listed in the below linked policy, however, can be generalized as a subset of pathogens which are associated with high-risk biological research.
All researchers who utilize pathogens in their research should visit the updated DURC and PePP Policy to review the policy and determine if it applies.
For questions, contact Matt Stinoski, WVU Institutional Biosafety Officer, at mstinosk@mail.wvu.edu.
