The Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office is now the focus of a multi-agency investigation — as questions mount over how millions of tax dollars are being spent and whether the public is getting a return on that investment.
The Louisiana Legislative Auditor officially launched a full financial audit of the Sheriff’s Office this week. The move comes just days after Sheriff Susan Hutson asked the New Orleans City Council for an additional $13 million to fix critical infrastructure issues inside the city’s aging jail.
But instead of writing a check, councilmembers demanded a closer look at the department’s books.
“We’re not seeing that level of transparency,” said Council President Helena Moreno, who has been one of the most vocal critics of the sheriff’s fiscal management looking at the 2023 Sheriff's audit. “She keeps saying these funds are restricted. We’re seeing they are not. There’s a $14 million unassigned fund balance and roughly $20 million in cash on hand.”
According to public audits submitted by the sheriff’s office, there’s a significant amount of money that appears to be unallocated, prompting concern over why the department is asking for millions more in emergency funds.
“We’ve given more money to this sheriff than ever before,” said Council Vice President JP Morrell, who compared the council’s role to that of a financial watchdog. “And now we want to see the receipts. You want us to give money without kicking the tires?”
After a request from Moreno and state representative Jason Hughes, the Louisiana Legislative Auditor’s team is expected to spend the coming weeks reviewing records, reports, and budget allocations from the sheriff’s office.
The legislative audit is only one part of a growing number of investigations into the jail and the sheriff’s office.
Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill's office is now coordinating with both the State and Orleans Inspectors General on broader reviews of spending, jail operations, and leadership decisions, including the recent escape of 10 inmates from the jail.
City officials have also issued subpoenas for the sheriff’s communications, including emails and texts, from the night of the jailbreak and beyond another layer of accountability added to an already intensifying probe.
At the center of the Council’s financial concerns is Sheriff Hutson’s refusal to join BRASS, the city’s financial tracking system that allows real-time visibility into spending.
“She keeps calling BRASS a distraction,” Moreno said. “But we see it as accountability. If she won’t enter BRASS voluntarily, then maybe it’s time for the federal consent decree judge to mandate it.”
Just two months ago, the New Orleans Inspector General issued a formal warning, stating it was dangerous and irresponsible for the sheriff’s office to continue operating outside of BRASS, especially while asking for more public money.
In council hearings this week, members also pressed Sheriff Hutson on a special fund — reportedly made up of vending machine profits, donations, and other discretionary sources which amounts to about $250,000 annually.
For two years, Moreno says she has been asking Hutson to redirect that money toward jail security improvements instead of expenses like hotels, conferences, and Mardi Gras events.
“She flat-out said no,” Moreno said. “If this is truly a crisis, then there shouldn’t be a ‘fun fund’ for travel while we’re talking about inmates manipulating locks and escaping.”
Despite repeated funding increases over the past two years, including raises for deputies and a total of more than $50 million in council-approved funding, jail staffing remains stuck at just 60% of the necessary level.
“We want to make sure the deputies are getting that money, not spending it on frivolous things,” Moreno said three years ago after approving the funds.
Sheriff Hutson, however, insists she’s doing what she can to fix long-standing issues that go back decades.
But for now, the council says no new funding will be approved until the investigations are complete — and the sheriff’s office can show where the money has gone and where it’s going next.
