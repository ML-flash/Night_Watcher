Deputy Chief Minister Mukesh Agnihotri today said that the Congress government condemned the dastardly terrorist attack and killing of innocent tourists in Pahalgam of Jammu Kashmir two days ago.
Agnihotri, while addressing mediapersons here, said that “the Congress stands with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on any decision that the Centre takes to curb terrorism”.
He said that the Congress stood by the nation with its role of a responsible political party. He added that the Congress had always made clear its stance against cross-border terrorism. The role of Pakistan’s Army in the incident could not be ruled out.
Agnihotri said that the Union Government should take strong steps to ensure such incidents did not repeat for which it would have the full support of the Congress.
He said that the attack revealed gaps in the intelligence network of our agencies, but instead of levelling accusations, the Congress gave the top priority to national security and demands a decisive action by the Central Government.
