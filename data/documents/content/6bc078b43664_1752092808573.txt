A federal judge on Wednesday ordered an organizer of President Trump’s Jan. 6, 2021, rally at the Ellipse to pay $2,000 a day until she complies with a subpoena for records about her involvement in the event.
U.S. District Judge Donald Middlebrooks said Republican fundraiser Caroline Wren’s “pattern of disregard and non-engagement” has unnecessarily delayed proceedings in a lawsuit brought by Capitol Police officers accusing Trump of spurring the Capitol attack. It’s blocked the officers from accessing discovery “to which they are entitled,” he said.
“If these fines prove ineffective, I will consider additional steps to spur her compliance,” reads the order finding Wren in civil contempt.
The judge wrote that additional sanctions, such as incarceration, were possible if the organizer does not comply with the subpoena. But at a hearing Wednesday, he said he would prefer not to “resort to incarceration,” Politico reported.
The officers are seeking documents from Wren regarding the planning and fundraising for the event, in addition to communications about planning, security, encouraging attendance and the VIP section.
Longtime Trump ally Rudy Giuliani has also so far defied a subpoena stemming from the lawsuit. In court filings last month, a lawyer for the officers asked a different federal judge to compel the former New York City mayor’s compliance.
“Mr. Giuliani has failed to appear in this proceeding in any capacity,” lawyer Joshua Margolin wrote.
The suit against Trump and others involved in the riot, including the right-wing extremist Oath Keepers and Proud Boys, has been pending for four years.
The Hill requested comment from Wren.
