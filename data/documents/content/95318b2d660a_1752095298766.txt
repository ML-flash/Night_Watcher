House approves housing bill with funding for proven housing solutions
St. Paul, MN — On Tuesday, the Minnesota House passed its housing omnibus bill (HF2445) carried by Rep. Spencer Igo (R – Wabana Township) who says the bill focuses on the pillars of stability, accessibility, and diversity in housing.
“Housing is a crisis here in Minnesota, and we need to take steps that actually address the root cause. We are over 100,000 housing units short. We need more housing for all Minnesotans. This bill takes a step towards fixing this problem,” said Rep. Igo. “Dollars alone are not going to carry out the need in building homes that will help to get us back on track. The work is far from over. I am proud of the bipartisan work that we did to get this bill put together and provide more targeted solutions to Minnesotans seeking relief from the housing crisis.”
The legislation includes targeted investments in housing stock, homeownership programs, and rural development. It promotes public-private partnerships and policy reforms designed to remove barriers to construction across Minnesota.
Igo goes on to say, “When we take the steps needed to allow diversity in housing we create affordability. Those two things together create stability for all Minnesotans.”
The housing bill passed the House with bipartisan support and is most likely heading to conference committee, where differences between the House and Senate versions will be reconciled ahead of a final vote.
