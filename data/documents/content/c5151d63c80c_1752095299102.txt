1. Talk to your Local APEX Accelerator
Government contracting can be complex, especially for small businesses getting involved for the first time. Fortunately, there are offices ready to help Government contracting can be complex, especially for small businesses getting involved for the first time. Fortunately, there are offices ready to help you: the National APEX Accelerator Alliance (NAPEX). There are counselors in over 300 APEX Accelerator locations who will work with you to understand key steps and strategies for federal, state, and local government contracting. The National APEX Accelerator Alliance also provides guidance with SAM.gov registration.
2. Register in System for Award Management (SAM)
After consulting with an APEX Accelerator advisor, we encourage you to register to do business with the federal government through the System for Award Management (SAM.gov). Registration is required, must be renewed annually, and is free.
If you want to apply for federal awards as a prime awardee, you need a registration. To do so, set up a SAM.gov account (Your username and password are managed by Login.gov). Then, validate your entity as unique and existing to get a Unique Entity ID (UEI number). If your principal business is located in the United States or U.S. territories, you will need your Tax Identification Number(TIN), which you can request by visiting www.irs.gov, to do so. Once you obtain your UEI number, you will then complete the SAM.gov registration modules to get a Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code. Fully registered business entities will have both a UEI number and a CAGE Code. Once registered, be sure to renew your registration annually.
To view a summary of SAM.gov registration, please visit SAM.gov | Entity Registrations. To view an entity registration checklist, please visit SAM.gov | entity checklist. For answers to common questions, live chat, or phone support, please visit the Federal Service Desk.
Of relevance to disaster contracting, note that within the Assertions module of SAM.gov registration, you will indicate whether you wish to appear in the search known as the Disaster Response Registry, which contracting officials may use to identify companies with disaster response capabilities.
3. Understand FEMA’s Mission and Goals
FEMA’s mission, as authorized by the Robert T. Stafford Act, is to help people before, during and after disasters. To do so, FEMA maintains 32 Core Capabilities across 5 mission areas. When FEMA responds to a disaster, our goal is to contract with local businesses in the affected area, whenever practical and feasible. Because FEMA is a coordinating agency that also provides assistance to entities and individuals affected by a disaster, note that disaster contracting capabilities may also be sought by other federal agencies, State Emergency Management Agencies as well as tribal, territorial, and local governments. Note also that FEMA maintains pre-positioned or Advance Contracts, which may be transferred to local vendors when practical and feasible.

As you begin your search, understand that it is Private Sector responsibility to monitor and respond to contracting opportunities. Further, consider opportunities to work as a Prime Contractor as well as opportunities to work as a Subcontractor. Prime Contractors need to be registered in SAM.gov, as they would be working directly with a federal agency, whereas Subcontractors may not necessarily need to be registered in SAM.gov, as they would be working for the Prime Contractor. Key sites to monitor for contracting opportunities include:
- SAM.gov where you can complete an advanced search to monitor opportunities by Federal agency, NAICS Code, place of performance, and more.
- The Acquisition Planning Forecast System (APFS) of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which provides a forecast of anticipated contract actions above $250,000.
