• Supreme Court ruling: The Supreme Court ruled to limit the ability of lower courts to issue nationwide orders that temporarily stop the government from enforcing a policy. These orders have hampered President Donald Trump’s agenda for months.
• Trump touts “giant win”: The president celebrated the court’s decision, saying that a “whole list” of his administration’s policies can now move forward. Trump has claimed courts overstepped their power by handing down such nationwide orders. One of his temporarily blocked policies is his controversial plan to effectively end birthright citizenship.
• Birthright citizenship: The ruling leaves the future of birthright citizenship unclear, but signaled the president’s controversial plan to effectively end it may never be enforced.
• Other cases: The Supreme Court also handed down opinions for other major cases, including backing a group of religious parents who want to opt out their children from reading LGBTQ books in classrooms, rejecting the latest legal challenge related to Obamacare and punting Louisiana’s long-contested congressional map to the fall.
