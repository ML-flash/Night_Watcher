HAMTRAMCK, Mich. – The finger-pointing continues in Hamtramck following the news that police Chief Jamiel Altaheri has been put on administrative leave while an investigation occurs.
Local 4 broke this story for you Wednesday (May 21) night, and on Thursday, more details came to light.
This follows an anonymous letter to michigan state police, accusing the chief of “grooming members of the department” to cover up his alleged misdeeds.
Hamtramck Mayor Amer Ghalib reports that Chief Altaheri called his suspension a “retaliatory action” by the city manager, who denies it.
On May 22, the police union will support both the city manager and Chief Altaheri and ask community members to be patient as the investigation unfolds.
“The union believes it is the duty of the city manager, who oversees the chief’s position, to take these actions, no different than how the chief would be expected to handle. An allegation within the police department. As a union, we would ask for a fair and impartial investigation.”
