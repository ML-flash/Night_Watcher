The national leader of the New Nigeria People’s Party (NNPP) and former Governor of Kano State, Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, has received no fewer than 1,230 political returnees from the camp of Hon. Abdulrahman Kawu Sumaila into the NNPP.
The political returnees who were of the Waraka political group were received from Albasu and Sumaila Local Governments of Kano South Senatorial District. They were officially received at a political gathering held on Sunday at Senator Kwankwaso’s residence along Miller Road in Kano.
The event which attracted hundreds of party supporters, political stakeholders, and traditional leaders also featured jubilations and renewed calls for grassroots mobilization with an eye on the 2027 general elections.
In addressing the crowd, Senator Kwankwaso said the return of the Waraka group was yet another achievement with respect to uniting ideological politics and people-focused politics in Kano State.
“NNPP is different from other political party platforms because of our focus on integrity, development and people first,” kwankwaso stated.
“I am always delighted to receive fellow Nigerians who believe in our movement; not because they will gain from my office after the elections as my political offering as seen in the past when politicians earn from their election promises, and like to earn just because of political allegiance.
“This is politics of ideology, not politics of the highest bidder.”
He commended the courage of the returnees and urged them to actively contribute to building the party’s structures and promoting issue-based campaigns.
Speaking on behalf of the defectors, Jamilu Zamba and Maryam Romo expressed satisfaction with their decision to rejoin the NNPP. They cited Kwankwaso’s leadership style, transparency, and consistency as key factors behind their return.
“We have realized that this is where our political future lies,” Zamba declared.
“Kwankwaso has always stood by the people. He doesn’t play money politics. He plays politics that uplifts communities.”
In a similar vein, Maryam Romo highlighted the inclusiveness of the NNPP, particularly in giving women a platform to participate meaningfully in the political space.
The return of the Waraka group is widely seen as a major political boost for the NNPP in Kano South, a critical zone in the state’s political arithmetic. Political observers believe the mass defection could strengthen the party’s grassroots network and realign voter loyalties ahead of the next electoral cycle.
Also among the defectors were supporters from Bunkure and Tofa local government areas, further expanding the reach of the NNPP in Kano’s political landscape.
The NNPP continues to position itself as a strong alternative in Kano politics, riding on the popularity and grassroots appeal of Senator Kwankwaso, particularly among youth and rural voters.
