The Trump White House released its payroll for the first time this term and it’s the lowest in 16 years.
Total White House payroll amounted $44.1 million for 404 employees in 2025, which is the lowest it’s been since at least 2009 when adjusted for inflation, according to Open The Books. The number represents a 29% drop from the Biden White House’s $62.2 million in payroll for 565 individuals in 2024.
Despite the overall payroll cut, top staffers like White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles and Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt are both making $195,200, which is more than their predecessors. Former President Joe Biden’s chief of staff Jeff Zients earned $168,000 in 2024 while former White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre made $180,000 serving the previous administration.
The reduced budget is in part due to a smaller legal counsel. Trump’s White House budget for legal counsel is $3.8 million for 27 lawyers, while the Biden White House employed 45 lawyers at a combined salary of $6.3 million by the close of Biden’s term. That represents a cut of $2.5 million.
Since 1995, the White House has been required to provide Congress an annual report on the salaries of White House personnel. (RELATED: Biden White House Staff Is Largest Since Nixon, Costs Taxpayers $225 Million)
The White House is not paying multiple prominent employees, according to the Trump White House’s report. The employees are Marco Rubio as National Security Advisor, David Sacks as White House AI and crypto czar, Steve Witkoff as special envoy for peace missions and Paula White as senior advisor to the White House Faith Office.
The White House staffer taking home the biggest paycheck is Jacalynne Klopp, who works as an advisor and is earning $225,700 annually.
While President Donald Trump’s salary is not listed, he has previously said he would donate his salary to the government, a practice he’s maintained during his first term.
