CHICOPEE, Mass. (WWLP) — Newly introduced legislation in Massachusetts aims to prohibit federal immigration enforcement officers from wearing masks while on the job.
With the ongoing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids and detainments, agents often cover their faces with masks, but a state bill filed this week would prevent them from being in disguise. State Rep. Jim Hawkins is proposing legislation to ban law enforcement and immigration officials at all levels from concealing their identity while on duty.
It comes in response to concerns about transparency and accountability within ICE, as some lawmakers say current practices create fear and distrust. In the bill, offenders could face a misdemeanor.

Hawkins cited the controversial arrest of Tufts University graduate student Rumeysa Ozturk, who was detained on the streets of Somerville by ICE agents who were in disguise back in March.
Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons defended agents wearing masks last month saying, “I’m not going to let my officers and agents go out there and put their lives on the line, family on the line because people don’t like what immigration enforcement is.”
The ban would not apply to surgical masks used to protect against exposure to airborne diseases or exposure to smoke. ICE has yet to make a public statement on the bill.
