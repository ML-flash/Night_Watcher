The House of Representatives has agreed to claw back $8.3 billion in previously approved foreign assistance, passing a rescissions package that codifies cuts made over the last several months and slices away even more money for lifesaving aid.
President Donald Trump requested the cuts through a $9.4 billion rescissions package, which was sent to Congress earlier this month. Immediately, the package was applauded by House Speaker Mike Johnson, who said his chamber was “eager to eliminate” billions of dollars of "wasteful foreign aid spending.”
On Thursday, the House voted to do just that — but the margin was razor-thin. The package passed on a 214-212 vote, with four Republican lawmakers voting against the package and two abstaining. No Democrats supported the rescission request.
