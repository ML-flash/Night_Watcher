Monty Python’s Terry Gilliam said President Trump “destroyed satire” in a recent interview with The Hollywood Reporter.
“He’s f‑‑‑ed up the latest film I was working on,” the British filmmaker and comedian said in the interview, released Tuesday, when talking about Trump. “Because it was a satire about the last several years when things were going as they were. He’s turned it upside down. So he’s killed my movie.”
“That’s ‘The Carnival at the End of Days,’ right?” The Hollywood Reporter asked Gilliam.
“Yes. I had a subtitle that said: ‘Great fun for all of those who enjoy taking offense.’ That was how I approached it. I think Trump has destroyed satire. I mean, how can you be satirical about what’s going on in the way he’s doing the world?” Gilliam responded.
“With ‘Carnival,’ the other day I was thinking I was going to put a little preamble on it saying that what you’re about to see takes place during the period historians refer to as the Trump lost years from 2020 to 2024,” he added.
In 2020, English actor and comedian Eric Idle, another member of Monty Python, threatened to sue the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) for the use of a Monty Python song in a political attack ad.
Idle posted online that the NRCC had “stolen” Monty Python’s “Lumberjack Song” in an ad taking aim at a Democratic representative.
“While we sue these low life thieving reprobates lets VOTE for Cindy to piss them off,” Idle said in his post. “Are all Republicans now lawless? Whatever happened to America?”
