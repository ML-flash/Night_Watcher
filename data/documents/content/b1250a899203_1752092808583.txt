President Trump is alerting countries around the world of impending tariff rates that they will face when sending goods to the United States, hitting prominent trading partners and poorer nations alike with steep duties as he reorients U.S. trade policy.
Trump on April 2 announced “reciprocal” tariffs on dozens of other countries, using trade deficits to help calculate the tariff rate. But a week later, he lowered those rates to 10 percent for 90 days as markets reacted negatively, giving time for negotiations.
With the 90-day window set to expire Wednesday, Trump this week has been issuing letters to countries informing them of the new “reciprocal” rate that will go into effect on Aug. 1.

The White House managed to strike a few deals during its 90-day pause. They brokered a trade agreement with the United Kingdom and solidified the contours of agreements with China and Vietnam.
Trump has sent mixed signals about whether there is still wiggle room for other nations facing the Aug. 1 deadline for tariffs to go into effect, but the White House is expected to issue dozens of letters this week.
