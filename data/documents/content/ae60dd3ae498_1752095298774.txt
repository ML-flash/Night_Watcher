U.S. Global Health Legislation Tracker
Published:
This tracker provides a listing of global health-related legislation being considered by the 119th Congress (Jan. 3, 2025 â€“ Jan. 3, 2027). Currently, there are 19 pieces of legislation related to global health. They address topics ranging from global health security to reproductive health to the World Health Organization (WHO). Sometimes a bill may address broader topics, but this tracker focuses on the global health aspects of the legislation.
The tracker includes the bill title, sponsor(s), current status, and topic, as well as a short description of its global health-related provisions. The tracker includes bills only; resolutions are not included. Legislation is listed in alphabetical order by short title. In certain cases, identical bills have been introduced in both chambers of Congress (often referred to as companion bills). For example, the Global Health, Empowerment and Rights Act and the WHO is Accountable Act were each introduced in both chambers. Such companion bills are listed separately in the tracker.
The tracker will be updated periodically.
