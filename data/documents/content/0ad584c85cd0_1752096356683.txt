Below are the adjusted expenses per inpatient day in 2023 for nonprofit, for-profit, and government hospitals in every U.S. state, based on the latest estimates provided by Kaiser State Health Facts.
The figures are based on information from the 2023 American Hospital Association Annual Survey. They are an estimate of the expenses incurred in a day of inpatient care and have been adjusted upward to reflect an estimate of outpatient service volumes, according to the KFF.
The foundation notes the figures are “only an estimate of expenses incurred by the hospital” for one day of inpatient care and do not substitute actual charges or reimbursement for care provided.
