School of Law Dean Appoints New Designee to Serve as Chair of the Judicial Nomination Commission
April 28, 2025
In November 2024, New Mexico voters approved Constitutional Amendment 3, granting the Dean of the School of Law the authority to appoint a qualified designee to chair Judicial Nominating Commissions when necessary. This change provides greater flexibility for the School of Law’s leadership.
Dean Camille Carey made her first appointment under the new amendment by designating Associate Dean Steven Homer to chair the Twelfth Judicial District Court Judicial Nominating Commission, which convened in Alamogordo on March 19, 2025.
“The passage of Constitutional Amendment 3 ensures we can balance the responsibility of chairing the judicial nominating process and providing the School of Law with the focused leadership it deserves,” said Dean Carey. “Associate Dean Homer brings a wealth of experience in legal education, public service, and judicial values to this role, and I’m confident he will serve with integrity.”
Associate Dean Homer currently serves as Associate Dean for Academic Affairs and Director of the Legal Analysis and Communication Program at the School of Law. He joined the faculty in 2004 after serving as a special assistant attorney general for the Child Support Enforcement Division at the New Mexico Human Services Department. He also worked in private practice where he focused on family law and general civil litigation.
“I'm honored to be able to assist the Dean with the School of Law’s vital function in the judicial nominating process. Chairing a judicial nominating commission is an excellent way to engage with the wider legal community by meeting members of the bench and bar across the state,” said Associate Dean Homer.
