    "description": "Richard testified that she was present at an altercation in Combs' home in which he became 'belligerent' as Ventura attempted to make him eggs. Richard testified that Combs grabbed the skillet Ventura was using and attempted to hit her over the head with it. She alleged Ventura dropped to the ground into fetal position while Combs punched and kicked her, eventually putting his arm around her neck and dragging her upstairs by her hair. 'I was scared for her,' Richard told the court. 'I had never seen anything like that before.'"
